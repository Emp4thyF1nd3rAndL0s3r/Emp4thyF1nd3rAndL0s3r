### **About Me:**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge of coding.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about who I am, and what my interests are.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a project with a knowledgeable relative.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with where to start in reading and interpreting coding.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about gardening. I might know a bit, or I'll try to refer you to someone who knows more!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/He/Him/They/Them (Don't be shocked!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: The bees that contribute to more than half of pollination in the United States are native and solitary. All honeybees are non-native to the United States, and can create resource competition for native bees. Native bees can be of the bumblebee species, and some specialize in the pollination of specific crops. 

### **Some Things I've Accomplished:**

I've been a Master Gardener since 2021.
I'm a parent to 3 human beings. One of them is an adult.
I'm also an aunt (prounoun adjustment), and stand-in grandperson.
I'm new to having chickens and guinea fowl as livestock.
I've completed the certification for HTML, JavaScript, and Intro to IT in Codecademy.
I've completed one college program, but not the degree.
I've probably completed the coursework to fill the degree requirements for the program I completed while pursuing a degree in other programs.
I can recognize my boundaries, and communicate when they are crossed.
Depending on how badly you've crossed them, I don't care if you like how I communicate that they've been crossed.
I take screenshots of unwanted inappropriate conversations.
I wrote a letter to the President and Vice President in 2020. (I did not get a response.)
I believe I matter, even if you disagree.

### **Some Things I'm Still Processing:**

I don't really know my relatives beyond my immediate family.
I don't think my siblings have enough time to be as tough as they acted when I was a kid, but I still consider them formidable.
I waver from wanting to contribute to legislation to wanting to hide under a rock.
I have doubts about ever completing a degree.
I think most men online are predators.
My opinion is validated by other men (_especially_ when they want to debate it, instead of appropriately adjusting their behavior).
I know that some women are, too.
I have a really hard time asking for help because of this ^^^.
I should be at a place where I feel like I'm financially stable, but I can't help but prepare for the day when someone tries to scam me out of security. (Also because of this ^^^)
Current events have reinforced my belief in the likelihood of this happening.^^^
